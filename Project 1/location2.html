            Develop three separate pages dedicated to each of the three places you want to showcase.
            Each page should contain:
            A header, nav, section for main content, and a footer.
            A paragraph describing the place.
            At least 2-3 images with a figure number and a short description for each.
            Images should be resized (using a photo editor) to fit neatly within the web page and ensure faster downloads.
            All images should be uniformly sized, with widths not exceeding 650 pixels and each being less than 100kb in total size.
