            Write a paragraph explaining the purpose of your website. This paragraph should be at least 4-6 sentences long.
            Features to include:
            An unordered list of the places you're showcasing.
            Use a special image as the bullet point. This should either be created by yourself using tools like Microsoft Paint, pixlr.com, or another photo editor. If you find one online, ensure it's resized appropriately.
            Include a background image (either in the body or another segment of the page like the header or section). This background image does not count toward your total images. It should provide a texture or feel to your page.
