            Tinaktak is a flavorful Chamorro dish from Guam, 
            featuring ground beef or chicken that closely resembles
             the Filipino ginataan dishes. The differnce is found 
             in the uniquely Chamorro use of cooking 
             beef/chicken/venison and tomatoes with the coconut milk, 
             with a touch of lemon pouder. This combination of tomatoes, 
             coconut, lemon, and beef is rarely done in the Philipines. 
             Your choice of protein is cooked with coconut milk, 
             potatoes, and vegetables like green beans or spinach. 
             It's creamy, savory, and uniquely tropical, 
             thanks to the addition of coconut. It's a 
             comforting and satisfying meal that showcases 
             the diverse culinary influences of the Pacific Islands.

             Kadun pica, also known as "kadun pika" or "kadu pika," 
             is a popular spicy dish from Guam, reflecting the island's 
             vibrant culinary heritage. "Kadun" means meat in Chamorro, 
             the indigenous language of Guam, and "pika" refers to spicy.
             Essentially, kadun pika translates to "spicy meat."
             The dish typically features marinated chunks of meat, often venison, 
             pork, chicken, or beef, which are then cooked with a spicy blend of 
             ingredients such as hot peppers, onions, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, 
             and lemon juice. The heat level can vary depending on personal preference 
             and the type of peppers used, but it's generally known for its fiery kick.
             This dish is not only a culinary delight but also a cultural symbol, 
             representing the fusion of indigenous Chamorro flavors with influences 
             from Spanish, Filipino, and Japanese cuisines. It's a must-try for anyone 
             looking to explore the diverse and dynamic food scene of Guam.

             Kelaguen is a beloved dish from Guam, 
             renowned for its bold flavors 
             and simple preparation. It's a type of Chamorro cuisine, 
             deeply rooted in the island's indigenous culinary traditions. 
             Kelaguen typically features diced 
             or minced meat, often chicken or fish,
             but sometimes shrimp, venison, or beef 
             which is marinated in a mixture of lemon juice, 
             grated coconut, green onions, onions, and hot peppers.
             What sets kelaguen apart is its bright and tangy flavor profile, 
             derived from the combination of citrusy 
             lemon juice and the unique addition of 
             grated coconut. The hot peppers provide a 
             spicy kick, while the green onions and onions 
             add freshness and depth to the dish. It pairs well with the famed 
             Chamorro red rice and tatiyas (pronounced tatizas) 
             an ancient Chamoro flat bread similar to the Mexican tortillas. 
             Kelaguen is typically served cold or at room temperature, 
             making it a refreshing option for warm climates like Guam's.
