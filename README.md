Instructions:

1. Setup:
At the root level, create your main page named index.html.
Create a folder named CSS at the root level and within it, create an external CSS file named styles.css.
Also, create a folder named images at the root level to store all the images you will use for this project.
2. Common Structure:
Every page should contain a header, nav, section, and a footer.
The header, footer, and nav sections should be consistent across all pages. Only the section (main content) should change.
The nav section must have links to each of the 5 pages.
3. HomePage (index.html):
Write a paragraph explaining the purpose of your website. This paragraph should be at least 4-6 sentences long.
Features to include:
An unordered list of the places you're showcasing.
Use a special image as the bullet point. This should either be created by yourself using tools like Microsoft Paint, pixlr.com, or another photo editor. If you find one online, ensure it's resized appropriately.
Include a background image (either in the body or another segment of the page like the header or section). This background image does not count toward your total images. It should provide a texture or feel to your page.
4. Place Pages:
Develop three separate pages dedicated to each of the three places you want to showcase.
Each page should contain:
A header, nav, section for main content, and a footer.
A paragraph describing the place.
At least 2-3 images with a figure number and a short description for each.
Images should be resized (using a photo editor) to fit neatly within the web page and ensure faster downloads.
All images should be uniformly sized, with widths not exceeding 650 pixels and each being less than 100kb in total size.
5. Food Page:
Create a page dedicated to showcasing popular or exotic foods from the region.
Use the same structure and requirements as the "Place Pages".
6. Styling:
Use the styles.css file located inside the CSS folder to style all your pages.
Ensure:
The pages have appropriate titles.
Elements like images, headers, fonts, container widths, and lists are styled.
You incorporate font colors and types.
Make sure your design is cohesive and visually appealing.
Do not use inline or internal CSS in your HTML pages.
